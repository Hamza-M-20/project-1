Game Name: Snake Game (Built with DOM Manipulation)

DESCRIPTION

A modern twist on the classic Snake game ‚Äî built without `<canvas>`, using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

The goal? Navigate your snake using the arrow keys, eat food to grow, and avoid colliding with walls or yourself. The game gets progressively challenging as the snake grows longer with each bite!

Why This Game?

I chose Snake because it's a timeless classic ‚Äî simple in rules, but challenging in gameplay. Building it with DOM elements (instead of canvas) helped me deeply understand grid logic, element creation, and real-time updates via JavaScript.

  MVP USER STORIES
  
  As a user I will have a grid which will be 20*20 squares in javascript or Html.
  I want to be in control of movements of the snake in the grid either up, down , left and right.
  I will have food appear immediately in a random grid square. snake will increase in size every time it eats the food
  As a user I want the game to end whenever the snake hits the wall or runs into itself and it should assign scores whether I lost or won condition.
  As a user i want the game to start immediately the moment i open the browser and restart the moment i hit the restart button.
  food will be random on the grid and new one should appear each time the snake eats it.

  Enjoy the game ‚Äî and don‚Äôt eat yourself! üêçüí•
